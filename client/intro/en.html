<h5>How to Play</h5>

You can playtest it with this web app in the following modes (each player needs to play on their own desktop/tablet/mobile browser):<br><br>

Online - You can play the entire game online with your friends (like in boardgamearena)<br>
Offline - You can use this web app to virtually select the cards you want to play, randomise and assign roles. Offline, you should conduct a quick night phase so the relevant characters know one another, prepare a simple board by drawing a few lines on a piece of paper and use your own tokens to represent your character<br><br>

<h5>Backstory</h5>

A murder has been committed in the presence of an eyewitness. Right after the act, the murderer caught a glimpse of someone in the shadows running away, but s/he didn't see who it was. However, the witness saw the murderer's face.<br><br>

The setting is an isolated country house with only a few people. Amongst them is a cop working undercover for his/her own reasons, and who decides to stay undercover while investigating the murder.<br><br>

The other people may include:
<ul>
	<li>people who love the victim and who want to see the murderer brought to justice</li>
	<li>people who believe the victim deserved to die and who want the murderer to get away with the crime</li>
	<li>accomplices who aided and abetted the crime</li>
	<li>a madman who wants to be hanged for something he didn't do</li>
	<li>a martyr who would like to die in service of a good cause</li>
	<li>a trained bodyguard who would like to prevent further deaths and who vows to protect the witness at all costs</li>
</ul>

The isolated location makes escape by foot virtually impossible, and the only vehicle has been suddenly borrowed by someone visiting town. Once that person returns, the murderer will make a run for it and escape, and possibly hide and evade capture forever. Before then, with or without the witness' help, the police must arrest the right person.
